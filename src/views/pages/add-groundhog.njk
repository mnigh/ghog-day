  <div class="max-width--850">
    <p>{{ site_title({ url: false }) }} aspires to be (and maybe already is) the leading data source for prognosticating animals and their yearly predictions. As such, the door is very much open to adding talented, up-and-coming groundhogs to our roster of classic, mainstream groundhogs.</p>
    <p><a href="https://forms.gle/fki9UL1kwjSusbL59" target="_blank">Here is a Google Form you can use to submit a new groundhog</a>. It should take you about 5 minutes.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to <a href="#editing-a-groundhog">update/amend data for existing groundhogs</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="h3">Submitting a new groundhog</h2>
    <p>I need 3 things to add a new groundhog:</p>
    <ol class="with-decimals">
        <li>Basic info about your groundhog
          <ul class="with-bullets"><li>Name, location, a ~50 word description, contact info, etc.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>A list of predictions by year
          <ul class="with-bullets"><li>eg, <code>2022: early spring</code>, <code>2021: longer winter</code>, etc</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>A photo
          <ul class="with-bullets"><li>Try to find a clear photo of the groundhog without people.</li></ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Once you have your photo handy, it should only take 5 or so minutes to <a href="https://forms.gle/fki9UL1kwjSusbL59" target="_blank">submit your groundhog</a>.</p>

    <p class="mb--0">I have tried to make sure that all data on the site is accurate but mistakes do hpapen. If any information is incorrect or incomplete (eg, to add more predictions, edit a groundhog, change the photo), please email me at <a href="mailto:paul@groundhog-day.com">paul@groundhog-day.com</a> to let me know.</p>
